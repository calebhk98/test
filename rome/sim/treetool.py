"""Tech-tree merge and PER-TECHNOLOGY audit.

The point of this file is the `judge` command.

The first version of this project graded itself on ONE number: what year the
simulation reached a transistor. That is the wrong test. A tree can produce a
plausible-looking end date while being wrong about almost every node in it.
The right test is whether each technology, taken ON ITS OWN, is honestly
specified: does it declare the capabilities it actually needs, is its cost
proportionate, could someone holding only its prerequisites really build it.

`judge` scores every node in isolation and reports the defects by name.

    python3 rome/sim/treetool.py merge          # branches -> tech_tree.json
    python3 rome/sim/treetool.py judge          # score every node, summary
    python3 rome/sim/treetool.py judge --full   # every defect, node by node
    python3 rome/sim/treetool.py judge --id X   # one node's report card
