# THE USER'S THREE QUESTIONS. Q1: does training ten times as many smiths
# actually cut the cost of a smith? Q2: can a technology raise output per
# worker without replacing the worker (labour.py's labour_productivity),
# and is it wired to real tree nodes rather than invented ones?
# =============================================================================

# --- Q1: train ten times as many smiths, measure what a smith costs, before
# and after - exactly as asked, rather than trusting the comment in
# labour_price_factor that claims the price comes back down. household_room
# is patched open for this one check because the question is about the
# PRICING mechanism (labour_pressure vs market_supply), which is orthogonal
# to the household-capacity gate hire() also enforces; nothing else in this

# --- JOB: the rubber bug (ac69bfb, e88a822) recurs across the tree. A node
# can consume a material nothing in its own ancestry can produce, and the
# game will still sell it at a flat book price - so you could build an
# aluminium monoplane in Rome 100AD with no grid, no generator, no
# electrolysis cell, buying the metal at 6 denarii a kilo. This pins the 24
# materials audited and fixed for that gap (see rome/data/review/
# MATERIAL_GATING.md for the full audit, including the ~69 materials judged
# genuinely purchasable in antiquity - iron, copper, wool, clay, timber,
# salt and the like - where no gate is correct).
#
# The walk follows BOTH `pre` and `req_any` - a node can be reached either
# way (ac69bfb's own JOB 3c, and _node_explain's "req_any COUNTS AS
# UNLOCKING" above, make the same point) - and a req_any OPTION may name a
# material rather than a node ("a purchasable commodity", see
# substitution_quality), which is not something to recurse into. And the
# graph is genuinely cyclic once req_any counts (junction_transistor ->
# silicon_path -> point_contact_transistor -> junction_transistor is one
# example already noted elsewhere in this tree) - a visited set is not
# optional here, it is the difference between this check finishing and an
