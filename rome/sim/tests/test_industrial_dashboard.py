# THE INDUSTRIAL DASHBOARD: `capacity`, `economy`, `changes`. A player who
# had already won the game asked for one command that answers "what
# physical capability does my society currently have, not just what I know
# how to build" - capacity, demand and surplus per material; power capability
# by scale; mines with their utilisation; the project portfolio sorted by
# what actually constrains it; spare founder-hours, staff and cash; a short
# economic summary with detail behind an explicit ask; and `changes N` for
# what moved over the last N years. See protocol.py's own block comment
# above _material_capacity_rows for the full design note.
