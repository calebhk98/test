# THE DEMOGRAPHICS FIX: the labour market was sized for a village. Measured
# on the pre-fix build: market_supply("smith") was 22,500 hours - 11.25
# people - for the whole of Rome, and hiring one scholar moved
# labour_price_factor from 1.0000 to 1.6151, a 61% jump, against a
# civilisation of 65,000,000 the game never told the player it was not
# actually reaching. Three things to pin: the reachable pool for a common
# trade is now realistically sized, a genuinely scarce or literacy-bound
# trade still spikes, and the 'population' command that is supposed to make
# all of this visible actually says what it claims to.
# =============================================================================

# --- a common, urban trade (smith - no special note, on the explicit
# "common" list) now reads a real town's worth, not a village's. Pinned to
# the formula itself (TOWN_POPULATION_REFERENCE x TRADE_DENSITY["common"] x
# HOURS_PER_PERSON_YEAR at Rome's own pop_scale of 1.0) rather than to a
# bare "> 11.25", so a future recalibration of the constants moves this
# check's expectation with it instead of silently drifting out of sync.
