# THE AGGREGATE AFFORDABILITY WARNING. Five naive playtests, five different
# civilisations, and four of them bankrupted themselves the same way: two or
# three "almost everything rests on this" foundations, each individually
# priced correctly and honestly by `start`'s own "on_credit" forecast, started
# together on a poor_scholar's opening capital. Nothing added them up. These
# checks pin committed_spend()/funding_capacity() (economy.py) - the one
# formula, not two - and the player-facing warning `start` now builds from it.
# =============================================================================

# --- committed_spend() is the exact sum `money` already printed, not a
# second total that could drift from it.
