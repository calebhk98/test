# of them pure knowledge (a theory, a hand technique, a machine-tool
# accessory) with no premises, staff or standing cost to speak of. The audit
# zeroed upkeep on every one of those that had no revenue either - a node
# with revenue is already a going concern by the tree's own definition - and
# kept it only on physical plant (furnaces, mills, mines, chemical process
# works) and a short hand-picked list of named facilities (hospitals,
