# playtesters (Han, Rome) were told from turn one that the hedge against
# being sacked was "walls, firearms, powerful friends, and copies of your
# work kept somewhere else", acted on it the moment it was said, and were
# still sacked - because the strongest of those hedges,
# HAZARD_COUNTERS["sack_chance"]'s biggest single share, sits behind a
# scientific_method -> corpus_written -> corpus_dispersed -> academy_network
# chain whose own `yrs` fields (already shown per-node, already the basis
# of `path`'s "Longest serial chain" line) sum to a real, un-buyable-down
# floor, and nothing before this said the chain had a length at all.
