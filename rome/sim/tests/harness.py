"""Shared fixtures, imports and check-recording machinery for the split
test suite (see rome/sim/tests/__main__.py for the runner).

This is test_regressions.py's own former preamble (import block, TREE/NODES/
ORDER/GOAL, check()/slow_check()/proto()/sim()/run_it()/_par_map(), the
subprocess-timing patch and the --jobs parsing), moved here VERBATIM so every
topic module in this package can do `from .harness import *` and see exactly
what the old flat script saw at the top of the file. Every topic module is
still just top-level code that calls check()/slow_check() at import time,
in file order - splitting into files changes nothing about how a check runs,
only how the source is organised on disk.

A few names below (_mk_loom_sim, _hazard, _rel/_LOADTEST_DIR, and the whole
family of `from engine.protocol import X as _Y` mid-file imports) are not
part of the ORIGINAL top-of-file preamble - they are helpers the original
flat file defined once, inline, at their first point of use, and then called
again many hundreds (sometimes thousands) of lines later, in what is now a
DIFFERENT topic module. Since Python executed the whole file as one module,
that just worked; split into separate modules it would not, so those few
reusable, side-effect-free pieces (pure functions, pure imports, or a plain
string constant + an idempotent os.makedirs) are ALSO defined here once and
re-exported, while the topic module that originally introduced them keeps
its own verbatim copy too (harmless - it simply shadows the harness-provided
name with an identical one within that module's own namespace, exactly
reproducing the original file's behaviour there).
