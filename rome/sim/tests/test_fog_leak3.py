# FOG LEAK #3: `bounty` named hidden prerequisites outright where `why` -
# reading the exact same missing list through start_reason's visibility
# filter - correctly said only "N other things you have not heard of yet".
# An external blind playthrough found three examples (industrial zinc
# leaking power_grid, the getter leaking its induction-coupling prerequisite,
# the vacuum tube leaking its hidden cathode) because `bounty` built its own
# "missing prerequisites" list straight off n["pre"], with no fog filter of
# its own. Reproduced generically below rather than pinned to one node name,
# so it keeps catching this the next time a command grows a second copy of
# the missing-prerequisite sentence instead of calling
# missing_prereq_message (fog.py) - the one place this is now written.
