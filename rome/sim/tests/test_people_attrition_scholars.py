# .8 people? I feel like all employees/people should be measured in
# integers." Attrition used to multiply every trade by (1 - 0.035) every
# single year, so ten smiths lost exactly 0.35 of a smith and the engine went
# on carrying the fraction forever - a household could read "1.32 artisans"
# or "0.03 engineers" on its own roster, the latter drawing 0.03 of a wage
# while supervising nothing. Attrition is now a per-person roll against
# self.rng (sorted by trade name, for the same PYTHONHASHSEED-independence
# every other rng loop over this dict already has); hire() and train() now
# refuse a fractional `n` outright, and the auto_hire smoothing that used to
# write a continuous target straight into `employees` now spends its
# fractional remainder as that year's CHANCE of the next whole hire instead
# (`_stochastic_round`).
