# had never been displayed. Root cause: core.py's stall detector asked
# whether a trade was EVER wanted by the node (n["lab"], a fixed total)
# rather than whether the project still owes that trade anything

# the founder's remaining hours are the binding term: remaining 100, want 500,
# throttle 0.5 gives 50 hours the old way and 100 the new. A busy year with
# the founder stretched thin is exactly when a material shortage should bite,
# and it silently stopped biting. Nothing in this suite caught it, so:

# NO BEHAVIOURAL CHECK OF THE BRAKE ITSELF HERE, deliberately, and this is
# the honest reason: step() recomputes self.throttle from the year's material
# supply at the top of every year, so a test that sets self.throttle and then
# calls step() is testing nothing at all - it measured 900.0 hours spent both
# with and without a shortage, because the value it set had already been
# overwritten before the line under test ever read it. Driving a real
# shortage far enough to move the throttle is a fixture this check does not
# have. The two checks above pin the actual regression, which is the helper
# folding the brake in, and the composed expression is a single line in
# core.py's step(). A check that cannot fail is worse than no check, because
# it reads like cover.
