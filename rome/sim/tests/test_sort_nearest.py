# which needs hydrochloric_acid back again - a real cycle if that branch of
# the substitution is the one walked, even though a player who takes the
# other branch (lead_chamber) never sees it. A bitmask descendant index that
# assumes a DAG runs out of memory on cycles like this, which is exactly what
