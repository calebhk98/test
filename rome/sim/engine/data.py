    outright - `junction_transistor -> silicon_path -> point_contact_transistor
    -> junction_transistor` is a real loop once every option counts, and an
    earlier attempt to index the tree that way was OOM-killed by it.

    But 125 of the tree's groups have exactly ONE option naming a real node.
    That is not a choice between routes; it is a prerequisite that happened to
    be authored as a substitution group. `mat_bulk_steel`'s manganese_supply
    group is `{"mat_manganese": 1.0}` and nothing else, and because this walk
    used to follow `pre` alone, manganese was not in the goal's closure. A

    million denarii and had still not built `mat_bulk_steel` or any of the 51

    to 185 and cannot introduce a cycle: `pre` plus every single-option
    `req_any` edge in the whole 2,833-node tree is acyclic, checked directly.

    ONE RULEBOOK, deliberately. This lived as a separate `planning_closure` in

# template takes the target value already formatted as a percentage; every
# metric here is a 0..1 fraction, which is the only shape `win_condition`

# goals needs.
