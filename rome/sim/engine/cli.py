# DIFFICULTY, PRESENTED HONESTLY, AS WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS HERE: how long you
# have. The horizon was already a plain number the engine takes; a player who
# had just won the whole game proposed naming a few points on that same line
# - Challenge/Standard/Relaxed/Endless - rather than asking for four bare
# numbers with no sense of what any of them mean.
#
# THE ONE THING A NAME CANNOT FIX ON ITS OWN: the SAME horizon is a
# completely different offer depending which civilisation it is attached to.
# Measured with every stroke of luck removed - no events, no project
# failures, an immortal founder, the game's own planner doing the ordering -
# reaching the current goal has taken about 451 years from Han China and
# about 1,017 from Rome (see rome/data/review/PATH_SEARCH.md for the method
# and the full tables). A 500-year Standard is generous for the one and
# short of reachable for the other, and a menu that offers both civilisations
# and both horizons with nothing connecting them is offering a choice it has
# not explained. See _new_game's own use of this table for where that
# connection actually gets said out loud, to whichever civilisation a player
# has just picked.
#
# NOT RECOMPUTED HERE, EVER. A single dice-free trial takes anywhere from
# several seconds (a short horizon, as path_search.py's own search rounds
# run it) to minutes (a full-length one, per PATH_SEARCH.md's own timing
# notes) - far too slow for a menu a player is sitting in front of, and nor
# is it this file's place to duplicate planner.py/path_search.py's own
# measurement. Hand-updated if that document's own numbers change; a
# civilisation not in this table is simply not given a number, rather than
# being handed a guess dressed as a fact.

# Relaxed "600-700"; 650 is the middle of that range, still a single whole

# plain number, never `None` or infinity - and this file is not the place to
# teach all of those call sites a special "no limit" value, several of which
# live in protocol.py. 9,999 years is the answer instead: an order of
# magnitude past the longest dice-free floor measured for any civilisation
# above (1,017, for Rome) and further past that than any real game has ever
# been played, so nobody playing an actual game reaches it - which is the

    ONLY THE THINGS THAT ARE HONEST TO CHANGE WITHOUT RESTARTING ARE OFFERED
    HERE. Three of the five things a new game asks about are NOT, on purpose:

      - civilisation: the whole world (prices, values, what is missing, what
        is coming) is keyed to it. There is no "change civilisation" that
        would not just be starting a different game while pretending to be
        this one.
      - starting kit: it names an amount of money the founder arrived with.
        The founder arrived however many years ago this save's year 1 was;
        re-picking that now would only ever mean handing yourself money you
        did not start with, i.e. cheating, dressed as a settings screen.
      - fog of war: see protocol.load_state's own comment on this - a save
        played with fog cannot be resumed without it, because there is no
        way to make a player un-know the whole tree they have already seen.
        The reverse is just as dishonest: turning fog ON after playing
        without it would claim to hide a tree this sitting has already been
        shown in full.

    Horizon and mortality are not like that. The horizon is a date the
    player is choosing to stop by, not a fact about the world - moving it,
    either direction, changes nothing about what has already happened.
    Mortality can honestly move exactly one way: choosing, from this year on,
    to let the founder age and die is a real choice a person can make midway
    through anything; choosing to UNDO having already accepted that is not a
    choice available to anyone in this founder's position, so it is not
    offered here either - see the menu below, which only ever offers "on".
