    # ---- knowing how, and actually running it -------------------------------
    # THE DEEPEST THING ANY PLAYTESTER SAID ABOUT THIS MODEL was not a bug
    # report. It was: "you research the finance stuff and instantly make money
    # -- but shouldn't that just unlock the ABILITY to do it? You research
    # loans, now you can give out loans. What if you didn't give out any? And
    # inventing stock market maths without building a stock market, or the
    # assembly line without a factory, is a bit unlikely to pay."
    #
    # That was right, and it went to the middle of the economy. 1,337 of the
    # 2,831 nodes carry revenue and 1,256 of those also carry upkeep, so the
    # tree ALREADY described them as going concerns that cost money to run and
    # pay money back. The only thing missing was the act of choosing to run
    # one. Completing the research paid you whether or not you ever opened the
    # doors.
    #
    # So: `done` is what you KNOW. `operating` is what you RUN. Revenue and
    # upkeep follow `operating`, and nothing else does - the goal, the tree,
    # the prerequisites and the standing you earn all still follow `done`,
    # because knowing how to make a transistor is the achievement and does not
    # require you to sell any.

    # ---- A FAILED ATTEMPT TEACHES YOU SOMETHING -----------------------------
    # A player who had already won the game objected to the mechanic just
    # below as it stood: a failure reset the calendar floor to zero and rolled
    # again at the SAME probability, which models a society trying the exact
    # same programme with the exact same odds as if the first attempt had
    # never happened. Their own words: "if I fail my first crystal-growing
    # programme, that failure itself teaches my engineers a huge amount. My
    # next attempt should not be probabilistically identical." They also
    # named the other half of it themselves - "the second attempt should
    # probably inherit some progress" - because a high-pressure steam system
    # or a zone-refining line is not only an engineering problem, it is a
    # SOCIAL one: workshops retooled, a workforce that has seen the process
    # once, suppliers who already adjusted, regulators or patrons who already
    # sat through the pitch. A technical failure at the end does not erase
    # that diffusion, which is most of what a long calendar floor represents
    # in the first place (see _calendar_floor_remaining's own comment on what
    # these floors are actually made of).
    #
    # So this does BOTH, because they answer two different questions the
    # player asked in the same breath: the risk term is the ENGINEERING
    # lesson (what failed, and why, is now known and will not recur in the
    # same way), the calendar term is the SOCIAL one (the groundwork already
    # laid does not have to be laid twice). Both are diminishing and both are
    # capped strictly short of removing the danger or the wait entirely -
    # "should never be free" was the explicit brief, and a mechanic that let
    # enough failures drive the risk to zero or the wait to nothing would
    # just be a slower way of removing the hazard altogether, which is not
    # what was asked for.
    #
    # RISK: multiplies the node's own base risk by a factor that starts at
    # 1.0 (attempt one is not "probabilistically identical" to anything - it
    # IS the first data point, nothing has been learned yet) and decays
    # toward RETRY_RISK_FLOOR as failures accumulate, geometrically, so the
    # first failure buys the most and every one after buys less. Floored well
    # above zero: an engineering team that has failed four times still faces
    # a real chance of failing a fifth, because "we now understand this

    # A tester's question, and it is the right one to ask of a game that tells
    # you on turn one exactly which disasters are coming: "some techs might
    # counter that, like what if you build a mine that can mine gold for Rome,
    # or guns for a rebellion, or medicine for disease?" Until now the answer
    # was almost no: four hardcoded checks, none of them findable, and the
    # hazards were weather. They are not weather. They are the thing the whole
    # programme is for.
    #
    # Each entry is (node id, how much of the harm it removes, what it is).
    # They compound, and none of them takes a hazard to zero on its own: no
    # amount of sanitation stops a plague, it decides how many of your people
    # are still alive at the end of it.
