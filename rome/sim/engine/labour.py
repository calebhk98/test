        whether anyone who can read is available at any price; this is the

        abstracted labour-market scale market_supply() already uses for the
        share a scholar-family trade gets (25,000 hours at full population
        scale, of which a lettered trade gets 35% before literacy narrows it
        further) - not a second population model that has to be kept in step
        with the first, but that one.

        FOR `scholar` ONLY, THIS IS NOT THE WHOLE WALL. A player who typed
        `hire scholar 12` was refused at 5.9, "ever, at any price" - and
        auto_hire, forty years later with the same civilisation, held 146.4
        scholars, because step() smoothed self.scholars toward
        staff_capacity()'s institutional ceiling directly and never once
        called hire() or read this function. Fixing the bypass (see step(),
        core.py) without fixing the number it now has to respect would have
        made the game worse, not better: the goal itself, and two nodes on
        the only road to it, want 25 trained scholars, and the market-share
        formula above tops out at 6.36 even after every literacy technology
        in the tree - printing, paper, a school, three academies - because
        Rome's literacy_elite starts at 0.900 and the field is capped at
        1.0. An eight per cent gain is what "a society that reads more can
        staff more" is worth if reading is the only lever, and it is not:
        the actual reason a household of one can eventually field two dozen
        literate men is that a school, an academy or an imperial patron
        hands them over ALREADY TRAINED, on the institution's own payroll -
        which is exactly what staff_capacity()'s `sc` already computes, and
        already used to justify auto_hire's own math before this function
        capped hire() and train() at a sixth of it. So the wall a person at
        a keyboard is held to is the same market-share pool as before PLUS
        the same institutional pool auto_hire was already trusted to grow
        toward: a city of a million cannot produce twenty-five idle
        scholars for one household to hire off the street, but it can
        certainly produce them once that household has built the school
        that trains them and the network that pays for a second and a

    # ---- a technology can make the SAME worker do more, without replacing
    # them ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # THE SECOND QUESTION: before this, nothing in the engine let a
    # technology raise output per worker while leaving the workforce itself
    # untouched. Everything market_supply() and labour_pressure() model is
    # about how many HOURS a trade can supply and what hiring more of them
    # costs; nothing ever asked an hour, once bought, to be worth more than
    # any other hour of the same trade. A flying shuttle does not hire a
    # second weaver or replace the first one - the tree's own note on
    # tex_flying_shuttle says so ("one weaver now handles wide looms...
    # triples weaving speed"). That is a real technology this engine had no
    # way to represent.
    #
    # WIRED TO NODES THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE TREE, each cited from its own
    # note, not invented for this. Deliberately conservative and deliberately
    # narrow: only nodes whose own note describes making an existing trade's
    # hour do more work, not nodes that reduce how many people are needed
    # (that is automation, and the tree already has a separate, correctly
    # different mechanism for it - see tex_power_loom in commodities.py,
    # which raises national cloth OUTPUT, not weaver PRODUCTIVITY, and is
    # deliberately left out of this table). The bonus for each node is a
    # fraction of what its own note claims, because these numbers compound
    # with one another and with everything else in the economy, and a
    # technology tree with forty of these stacked at face value would make
    # the whole game about which order you build them in rather than what
    # they cost.
    #
    # (node, trade, bonus). Sourced, node by node:
    #   tex_treadle_loom    "speeds weaving noticeably" - the weakest claim in
    #                       the chain (the note itself says the weaver still
    #                       works the shuttle by hand), so the smallest bonus.
    #   tex_flying_shuttle  "triples weaving speed" - but weaving is a slice
    #                       of what the `artisan` trade covers in this model
    #                       (there is no dedicated weaver trade), so the
    #                       tripling is scaled down hard rather than applied
    #                       to the whole trade.
    #   tex_spinning_wheel  "roughly tripling output per spinner" - same
    #                       dilution reasoning as the shuttle.
    #   met_trip_hammer     "much faster than hand hammering... foundation of
    #                       heavy forge work" - smith.

        five. It is not the same claim as "is a trained natural philosopher",
        and an earlier version of this function used the one grouping for
        both: hiring three scribes raised effective_scholars() from 0 to
        4.0, so a node gated on "2 trained scholars" would start on the
        strength of scribes who had never been asked to do a philosopher's
        work, while STAFF_SOURCES - the advice this same household is given
        on how to get scholars - names only `hire scholar` and never scribe,
        chemist, engineer or merchant, which is strong evidence the five-way
        grouping was sized for the labour MARKET and reused for the staff
        ROSTER by mistake. train()'s own docstring already makes the
        non-interchangeability of the taught trades explicit ("the
        machinists you made are no use at all when you need a chemist");
        nothing about a chemist makes them a scholar either.

        self.artisans what they are, so it is the one place that has to add
        the grant back rather than let it be overwritten out of existence.

        it is counted separately, and manumission is modelled as strictly better

        First, buy_slaves added 0.55 artisans per person and manumit then added
        ANOTHER 0.55 for the SAME PERSON, so one human being yielded 1.1 workers.
        Manumission does not clone anybody. It makes the same person work
        properly, which is a rise from 0.55 to 1.0, so it adds 0.45.

        of any period absorbs that. The price now rises with the size of the
        purchase against the local market's depth.

        Third, it was INSTANT. Buy and free ten people and you had eleven
        trained artisans in the same tick, for money alone, with no founder
        hours and no calendar time. That strictly dominated freedman_staff, the
        node that models the same thing honestly at 900 founder hours and two
