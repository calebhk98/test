    really be able to tell how much money you would make from researching
    something? Shouldn't the payback be something you don't know until
    after research?" A break tester's own numbers say why it matters: under
    fog they built 540 technologies using EARNS/YR as, in their own words,
    "the only usable heuristic", and reached 95 of the 146 nodes on the road
    to the goal that way - not because they had worked out the tree, but
    because the exact payback figure told them which side branches paid and
    steered them straight past the spine. Real payback is a thing you learn
    by running a concern for a few years, not by reading a number off a
    prospectus before you have so much as broken ground.

    Two things this must never be:
      - RE-ROLLED. A fresh call to self.rng here would answer differently on
        two consecutive looks at the same screen, and would also consume a
        draw from the SAME generator the simulation itself steps with - so
        merely asking `why` twice would change how the game plays out.
        Read-only commands must not touch self.rng. Instead this hashes
        something stable for the LIFE of one game (this civilisation, this
        goal, this starting purse) together with the node's own id, so the
        same game asked the same question twice gets the same answer, and a
        different game is not guaranteed to.
      - A TIGHT SYMMETRIC BAND ON THE TRUTH. "400 +/- 50" tells you 400 just
        as plainly as the bare number did, because the midpoint gives it
        away. The low and high bounds below are pulled by two independently
        drawn fractions, so the middle of the printed range is not, in
        general, anywhere near the real figure, and averaging the two bounds
        does not recover it.
    It DOES widen with how well this node's own numbers are attested: `conf`
    is already in the tree data for exactly this reason (A well attested, B
    probable, C the author's estimate), so a guess about a well-documented
    Roman trade is tighter than a guess about a Han institution nobody wrote
    down the takings of, the same as a historian's own uncertainty would be.
