# k" by scanning every one of the tree's 2,849 nodes and all their req_any
# groups, on EVERY call - and _downstream_of calls it once per node on the
# frontier of its walk, so one `why`/`path`/`available` could fire it
# thousands of times. Profiled on a fresh, unfogged rome_100ad game, a single
# `available` made 6,954 such calls and 23.7 million dict lookups for 11.3s
# of an 11.33s command. The fix: walk every node ONCE, appending it to the
# reverse-index bucket for each id in its own `pre` and each `req_any`
# group's `options`, so `_unlocked_by` becomes a dict lookup.
#
# CACHE KEYED ON id(nodes), WITH A STRONG REFERENCE TO nodes HELD ALONGSIDE
# THE INDEX. `nodes` is normally the one global tree, loaded once and never
# mutated afterward (a repo-wide grep for assignments into a node's "pre" or
# "req_any" - see the report accompanying this change - turns up only
# offline tree-authoring tools that run before the tree is ever loaded, plus
# two places in test_regressions.py that mutate a small synthetic dict, and
# both do it before that dict's first use, never after these functions have
# already seen it). The test suite DOES build many short-lived synthetic
# node dicts, though, and id() is only unique among currently-alive objects:
# once a small dict is garbage collected, a brand-new dict can legitimately
# be allocated at that same address. A cache of {id(nodes): index} alone
# would then hand the new dict a stale index built for a completely
# different tree. Storing `nodes` itself in the cache entry keeps that exact
# dict alive for as long as the entry lives, so its id cannot be recycled
