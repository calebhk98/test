# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TYPED COMMANDS, for a person at a keyboard.
#
# Everything a player can do lived only in the JSON protocol above. `play` -
# the human front door - understood six things: next year, available, status,
# start, stop, quit. Money, hiring, teaching a trade, working for wages,
# policy, the ledger, saving: a human could not reach any of it without
# typing JSON at a prompt, and the menu's answer was to hand them
# {"cmd":"available"} and wish them luck.
#
# So this is a parser and NOT a second implementation. It turns a typed line
# into exactly the dict the JSON protocol takes, and hands it to the same
# _agent_dispatch below. There is one command set, one set of rules, and one
# place a new command has to be added. A typed game and a scripted game
# cannot disagree about what the game is, because underneath they are the
# same call.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What a person types on the left, the protocol's own name on the right. The
# single letters are the ones `play` has always used, kept because the older
# notes and anyone who has played before will still type them.
