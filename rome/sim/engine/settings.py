"""Where a player's stuff lives, and what they told the menu to remember.

Two different things share this file, and the difference matters:

  1. THE CONFIG - a handful of preferences that live OUTSIDE any one game,
     at a fixed place on disk, and are read again on the NEXT invocation of
     the process. This is what makes "put my saves somewhere else" stick
     without a flag: see PLAYER REQUEST #1 below.

  2. PER-SESSION META - a couple of fields (right now, just the horizon) that
     belong to one save file but are not part of the save format the engine
     itself owns (rome/sim/engine/protocol.py: SAVE_FIELDS, save_state,
     load_state). That file is rewritten from a fixed field list after every
     single command, so anything written here is not preserved there. It
     gets a small sidecar of its own instead.

Nothing in this module is imported by, or imports, protocol.py/core.py/
projects.py/labour.py/society.py/economy.py: it is filesystem bookkeeping
around the engine, not the engine. (protocol.py does carry a couple of
module-level variables this module's VALUES end up in - DISPLAY_WIDTH,
DEFAULT_AVAILABLE_LIMIT - but cli.py is what copies them there; this module
still never imports protocol.py, nor the reverse.)

THE CONFIG IS FOR THE APPLICATION, NOT FOR ANY ONE GAME. An earlier version
of this file, and of the main-menu Options screen built on it, held
"defaults for the next new game" here too - which civilisation, which
starting kit, fog of war, mortality, the horizon - on the reasoning that a
player who always starts the same way shouldn't have to retype it. That
reasoning was sound, but CONFIG_PATH is the wrong place for it: these are
facts about a PLAYTHROUGH, the same way fog and mortality are, and a player
asking "why is the save location next to 'which civilisation' on the same
settings screen" was asking the right question - the owner's own words, on
being shown that screen, were "change where saves are, change language,
change window size, etc? Not about each save, like fog or mortality?" So
the Options screen now holds only what is actually about the PROGRAM: where
saves go, how wide a line is, how many rows a table shows before paging,
and whether the welcome/tutorial text prints for a game that has not
started yet.

The "remembered default civilisation/kit/fog/mortality/horizon" capability
is not deleted, because a player who favours one civilisation and one kit
still should not have to retype them - it just no longer has a settings
screen of its own. _new_game (cli.py) still prefills its five questions from
whatever was chosen LAST TIME, and silently writes this sitting's answers
back as the new "last time" the moment the wizard finishes, the same way a
text editor remembers your last file dialog folder without asking you to
configure it. DEFAULT_CIV etc., below, are that memory; nothing edits them
directly any more.

Changing the horizon mid-game, or turning mortality on mid-game, are
reasonable things a player reaches for WHILE PLAYING, not before - that
capability lives in cli.py's in-game 'options' command (_ingame_options),
unrelated to this file's config and not moved by any of the above.

PLAYER REQUEST #1 - "saves in a place that survives": several players run
somewhere the default save directory (~/.rome-saves) is not the durable
storage they actually have - a fresh container on every terminal session,
with a persistent volume mounted somewhere else entirely. Three ways to say
where saves should go, checked in this order, so whichever one actually
survives in a given environment works:

  1. the ROME_SAVE_DIR environment variable, for a player who can export
     one line in a shell profile that DOES survive even when $HOME does not
  2. "save_dir" in the config file (see CONFIG_PATH below), for a player who
     sets it once from the Options menu and whose home directory is the
     thing that survives
  3. ~/.rome-saves, unchanged, for everyone who has not asked for anything
     else

DISPLAY WIDTH - "change window size": the renderers in protocol.py wrap text
and size tables to a number of columns that used to be a bare constant
(76, in most places), which is exactly the "terminal of a particular size"
assumption that cost players truncated ids on a narrower terminal. A player
can set an explicit width from Options; left alone (None), resolve_
display_width below asks the terminal itself via shutil.get_terminal_size,
and only falls back to the old hardcoded number when there is no terminal
to ask (a pipe, a redirected file, the test suite) - so nothing a script or
a regression check reads changes because this preference exists.

LANGUAGE - deliberately absent. The natural fourth item on a "window size,
save location" list is "language", and it is not here: this codebase has no
internationalisation to switch on. _localise_words/_localise_money in
protocol.py swap the NAME of the currency per civilisation (denarii,
hacksilver, beans, pence) - flavour, not translation - and the many
thousands of words of node notes (rome/data/tech_tree.json) and the
rome/knowledge/ corpus exist in English only. A menu entry offering
"language" with nothing behind it would be worse than no entry: a setting
that silently does nothing. Real language support would mean translating
every node note and every rendered sentence in protocol.py/cli.py (not a
small rewrite - protocol.py alone is thousands of lines of prose, generated
sentence by sentence from game state) and deciding what happens to
rome/knowledge/, which is English prose no translation layer touches
automatically. That is a project of its own, not a field in this file.
