    Backs `Sim.operating` (see the `operating` property on `EconomyMixin`
    below) so that a cache keyed off operating's exact membership -
    `capability_factor()`'s - cannot go stale, no matter which of the nine
    call sites across core.py/projects.py/economy.py/society.py adds to or
    discards from it, and without asking any of them to remember a second
    line. The `done`/`_done_changed()` convention this project already has
    relies on every one of ITS mutation sites remembering to call
    `_done_changed()` by hand; that is a real convention and it has held,
    but a second one just like it - one more rule written down at every call
    site instead of enforced at one - is exactly the shape that has already
    produced three drifted-apart bugs elsewhere in this codebase today. This
    set makes the equivalent mistake impossible for `operating` specifically:
    there is only one `.add`, only one `.discard`, and they are these. It is
    the same reasoning that made `revealed` (engine/fog.py) a property rather
    than a plain attribute, extended to a set instead of a ratchet.

    Every mutating method a plain `set` exposes is overridden so that
    swapping this in for `set()` changes nothing observable except that
    `on_change` now fires. Non-mutating methods (`copy`, `union`, membership
    tests, iteration, `len`) are inherited unchanged.

        any of the nine-odd call sites across core.py/projects.py/
        economy.py/society.py, and any future one, with nothing for any of
        them to remember. See capability_factor(), its only reader so far.

        A property (`self.operating` intercepting every READ, the way
        `revealed` in engine/fog.py intercepts every WRITE) was tried first
        and measured worse, not better: self.operating is read in the
        hottest loop in the engine - `_goods_category_state` and
        `goods_market_factor` alone read it roughly sixteen million times
        in the 300-year profile this fix was measured against - so a
        property's per-access overhead, paid on every one of those reads to
        protect a few thousand writes, cost far more than capability_factor
        saved; a 300-year profiled run got SLOWER (22.1s -> 27.5s). An
        `_InvalidatingSet` intercepts only mutation, which is what actually
        needs intercepting, at none of that cost: plain attribute reads
        (`in`, `for`, `sorted(...)`, truthiness) are exactly as fast as a
        plain set, unmeasurably so, because they are a plain set's own
        C-level methods, inherited unchanged.

        The gap a property would have closed is whole-object replacement -
        `s.operating = X`, which only two places in this codebase do: a
        fresh Sim's own __init__ (core.py), where there is nothing yet to
        invalidate, and load_state's generic `setattr` loop (protocol.py),
        which is NOT always acting on a freshly-constructed Sim - `load`
        issued mid-session through the agent/play JSON protocol loads into
        the SAME long-lived object a player goes on playing in, and every
        open/close/mothball after that load mutates .operating directly.
        Left alone, that setattr would silently downgrade self.operating to
        a plain, non-invalidating set for the rest of that process's life.
        load_state calls _reset_operating() (below) once, right after its
        generic loop, to close that one specific gap explicitly instead of
        taxing sixteen million reads to close a gap with exactly one door.

    # question was exactly the case that breaks: an automated loom should make
    # an enormous margin the day it opens, because handlooms are everywhere and
    # power looms are not, and that margin has to erode as the rest of the
    # world catches up, cushioned by the fact that cheaper cloth pulls in
    # buyers who could not afford cloth before. `commodities.py` already has a
    # bounded, elastic price built for exactly this worked example (see
    # COMMODITIES.md section 4.2), but it is a standalone module Sim has never
    # imported - its own header says so - because it reasons in tonnes against
    # a national output table and has no notion of "years since you personally
    # opened this," or "how rich a population you can reach": Sim already has
    # both (opened_year, pop_scale, self.economy). This reuses commodities.py's
    # IDEAS - a bounded, elastic price, and the loom's own twenty-times figure
    # - natively, rather than bolting a tonnage model onto a system that has
    # never tracked a single tonne of anything. Wiring commodities.py itself
    # into Sim is the larger migration COMMODITIES.md section 11 describes and
    # explicitly defers; this is not that migration.
    #
    # SCOPE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW. Only categories that are a tangible good
    # sold to a broad population get this: cloth (`textiles`), preserved food
    # and drink (`processing`), books and print matter (`printing`), cameras
    # and film (`photography`). Mining, instruments, transport and every
    # institution keep the flat figure - a mine's output already has its own
    # supply-and-price machinery below (MARKET_SHARE, material_price_factor)
    # answering a different question (what it costs YOU to buy ore, not what
    # a workshop earns selling a finished good), and a school or a patron is
    # exactly what the brief asked to leave alone.
    #
    # NUMBERS AND WHERE THEY CAME FROM, per category:
    #   eta (price elasticity of demand: how much buying responds to price):
    #     textiles 0.65 - apparel-demand studies typically put clothing's
    #       own-price elasticity in the 0.6-1.0 range, moderately elastic,
    #       neither a staple nor a luxury; picked at the inelastic end of that
    #       range so the early erosion the brief asks for is actually visible
    #       - at exactly 1.0 (unit elastic) revenue would sit dead flat as
    #       price moved, which demonstrates nothing. [C]
    #     processing 0.35 - agricultural-economics estimates for food-at-home
    #       demand (the USDA's Economic Research Service puts most packaged
    #       food categories around 0.2-0.6) cluster low: people keep eating
    #       whether or not canned milk or refined sugar gets cheaper. [C]
    #     printing 0.80 - discretionary but not a luxury in the pre-mass-media
    #       world these nodes describe; picked close to, but under, unit
    #       elastic. [C]
    #     photography 1.60 - camera and film equipment is squarely a luxury
    #       good throughout the period this applies to; luxury-goods demand
    #       studies commonly cite elasticities above 1.5 (fine goods and
    #       jewellery studies often land in the 1.5-2.5 range). [C]
    #   floor (price never falls below this fraction of the tree's own
    #     figure, however saturated the market): textiles and printing start
    #     from the bound already chosen for cloth (the one tracked commodity
    #     textiles maps to) in commodities.json, 0.35, nudged up to 0.40;
    #     processing starts tighter still, 0.45, because preserved food has a
    #     harder cost floor (a tin and the heat to seal it cost what they
    #     cost) and a harder ceiling on how much cheaper it can get before
    #     people just use raw ingredients instead, nudged up to 0.55;
    #     photography starts from coffee's bound in commodities.json, the one
    #     other luxury good that file prices, 0.5, nudged up to 0.55. Every
    #     nudge is the SAME finding: measuring this against the 700-year
    #     Monte Carlo runs (see the change's own report) showed a civilization
    #     already winning on the earlier, harsher floors on the edge of the
    #     700-year horizon (han_china_100ad, 2 of 10 seeds) losing every one
    #     of them once a goods concern's long-run earnings fell as far as the
    #     first pass had them fall. A model that turns a marginal win into a
    #     loss is not "more realistic," it is miscalibrated against a game
    #     this game already plays close to the edge of - so every floor here
    #     moved up by 0.05-0.1 from its first-pass figure, softening how much
    #     of the day-one margin is eventually given up, while leaving the
    #     shape of the curve (an early, visible decline) untouched.
    #   tau (years for the market to visibly respond to a new supply):
    #     textiles 35 - Britain's handloom weavers went from the dominant
    #       technology to a shrinking minority over roughly thirty to forty
    #       years, the 1810s to the 1850s; that is the number used for how
    #       long a cloth market takes to re-equilibrate around a new loom, at
    #       the slower end of that range for the same reason the floors moved
    #       - see above. Processing, printing and photography use a longer 40
    #       [C]: no equally specific diffusion-speed citation exists for
    #       those, so a longer, explicitly illustrative period stands in for
    #       one, and the same 700-year-horizon finding argued for slower
    #       rather than faster.
    #
    # EXTENDED, rome/data/review/COMMODITY_DYNAMISM.md's second and third
    # findings. Two gaps in the original four categories, both measured
    # directly against a live Sim:
    #
    # (a) ZERO CROSS-ELASTICITY. "One loom at age 20 earns factor 0.7840.
    #     With a second identical loom running: 0.7840. With ten: 0.7840."
    #     goods_market_factor() used each concern's OWN age as a private
    #     clock standing in for "how saturated is the market" - a real
    #     number for a lone producer, but a fiction once a second producer
    #     (yours, or - per this file's existing goods_reach_factor comment
    #     - the rest of the world's) exists, because nothing summed what
    #     they were jointly supplying. Fixed below by pricing off the
    #     CATEGORY's total supply (every concern you operate in it, not one
    #     node's private clock) rather than one node's own age in isolation.
    #
    # (b) NO REAL CONSUMER ECONOMY. The brief's own richest idea: "when the
    #     public has less money, they buy less. So if the price of food
    #     goes down, the price people would be willing to pay for diamonds
    #     or records would go up." That is an ordinary income effect
    #     (cheaper necessities free up spending on everything else, the
    #     same logic behind Engel's law) and this file had no channel for
    #     it at all - `processing` (food) and, say, `photography` (a
    #     luxury) moved on completely independent clocks. The brief also
    #     named the actual businesses this should cover - "alcohol, or
    #     wine... food like pizza... gambling, casinos... books, card
    #     games, movies, phonographs, record players, newspapers" - and
    #     grepping the tree for them turns up real, revenue-bearing nodes
    #     (fud_distillation_spirits, fin_gambling_house, fin_racecourse,
    #     fin_theatre_business, hom_printed_books, hom_playing_cards_printed,
    #     if_tin_foil_phonograph, prn_radio_broadcasting,
    #     fin_newspaper_business...) that were earning the tree's flat
    #     figure for ever, the same as an aqueduct. `essential` below marks
    #     which categories are necessities (only `processing`, food, so
    #     far - the one the brief's own worked example is about) and
    #     income_factor()/essential_price_ratio() below implement the
    #     effect: a discretionary category earns more as the player's own
    #     essential-goods concerns get cheaper, and is neutral (no effect,
    #     not a penalty) when the player runs none. See those methods' own
    #     comments for the mechanism and its honest scope limit.
    #
    # NEW CATEGORY NUMBERS, same [C] estimation method as the original
    # four (see the class comment above for how those were reasoned):
    #   fermentation (alcohol - brewing, distilling, vinegar) 0.55/0.45/35:
    #     alcohol demand studies commonly cite elasticities of roughly
    #     0.3-0.9 (a consumption habit, not a nutritional necessity, but
    #     also not as freely substitutable as a camera); floor and tau
    #     follow processing's "real cost floor" and textiles' diffusion
    #     pace respectively, as the closest existing anchors.
    #   leisure (toys, games, puzzles, books, instruments) 1.10/0.45/35:
    #     hobby and entertainment goods are usually cited above unit
    #     elasticity but below photography's fine-goods range.
    #   sound (phonograph, gramophone, radio broadcasting) 1.30/0.50/35:
    #     a luxury technology good, the same reasoning as photography but
    #     slightly less extreme - audio reached a mass market somewhat
    #     faster, historically, than the camera did.
    #   media (newspapers, advertising, lending library, telegraph
    #     business) 0.85/0.40/35: an information good, close to printing's
    #     own 0.80.
    #   commerce (inns, hotels, restaurants, department stores, trading
    #     posts, coffeehouses) 1.00/0.45/30: unit-elastic hospitality and
    #     retail demand (commonly cited 0.8-1.3); a shorter tau because a
    #     service business's custom is understood to shift faster than a
    #     manufacturing good's.
    #   entertainment (gambling, lotteries, theatre, professional sport,
    #     racecourses - cat values "luxury", "spectacle" and "law" in the
    #     tree, which is where fin_gambling_house, fin_lottery,
    #     fin_theatre_business, fin_racecourse and fin_professional_sport
    #     actually live) 1.80/0.50/35: the single most discretionary
    #     bucket here, above photography, matching how elastic gambling
    #     and spectator-entertainment demand is usually cited to be.
    #   personal (perfume, cosmetics, toiletries) 1.10/0.45/35: ordinary
    #     personal-luxury demand, the same order as leisure.
    # `essential` is omitted (defaults False, i.e. discretionary) on every

        the first rather than each independently pretending to have the

        unnecessary.

        FINDINGS_ROUND2 section R: MARKET_SHARE was a supply ceiling with no
        price response at all -- buying up to it cost the same per tonne as
        buying one kilogram -- and nothing made owning your own supply make
        the material CHEAPER, only available. Both halves are here: `need`
        and `_material_market_tonnes(emp_key)` are resource_throttle()'s own
        figures, so demand approaching the market ceiling raises the price on
        the same saturating curve labour_price_factor uses (negligible at a
        fifth of the ceiling, roughly double at the whole of it); owning
        enough of your own extraction (mine_capacity, forest_ha,
        nitre_bed_m2) to cover the need removes the premium rather than
        merely making the tonnes exist. This is the actual mechanism behind
        "the price of iron fell because supply rose": opening a mine lowers
        what iron costs YOU, specifically because you stop having to buy it
        at the margin.

        Groups demand the same way resource_throttle() now does
        (_demand_by_supply_tag): the same "checked each key alone" gap
        applied here too, understating the price pressure of a wire-heavy
        electrical age on copper by looking at copper_kg's share in
        isolation from copper_wire_kg's.

        GENERALISED: this used to return exactly 1.0, immediately, for any
        commodity id not already sitting in the hand-written MARKET_SHARE

        on it: clothes, a household, hospitality, and public benefaction. That
