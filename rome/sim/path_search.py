"""Find a working order in the world with the dice removed, then see how much
of it survives them.

THE OWNER'S OWN DIAGNOSIS, TAKEN LITERALLY. `planner.py` computes one
structural ordering by critical-path method and stops; this module is what
"solve the deterministic problem first" actually looks like. `run
--no-events` already turns off dated shocks, but a project's own risk of
FAILING outright is a separate roll in `projects.py:_complete`
(`self.rng.random() < n["risk"]`) that fires whether or not events are on -
so a fully dice-free trial needs a seeded rng whose `random()` always returns
1.0, never below any probability threshold anywhere in the engine (a
project's failure risk, the 3.5% yearly attrition roll, the 25% manumission
roll, the fractional-headcount rounding in `_stochastic_round`). See
`DetRNG` below. Nothing in `core.py`, `projects.py`, `labour.py`, `society.py`
or `economy.py` is edited to get this - the same rules run, against a
different sequence of "how did that roll come out".

THE FIRST QUESTION - DOES THE CURRENT PLAN EVEN GET THERE WITH THE DICE
OFF? - turns out to have a real, specific answer, not a shrug: no, and not
because of money or the generic scholar/artisan pools, both of which end up
abundant (tens of millions of denarii, hundreds of scholars and artisans).
It stalls on a small, fixed set of NAMED CRAFT TRADES the tree calls
`TRADES_ABSENT` - chemist, electrician, engineer, machinist, optician -
which do not exist in this civilisation at all until you personally teach
them (`labour.py:trade_available`), and which grow ONLY through
`step()`'s once-a-year, two-people-at-a-time auto-teach (core.py, "4a2"),
gated further by a 25-year per-trade cooldown. Once a trade's headcount is
above zero, `market_supply(t) <= 0.0` - the sole trigger auto-teach uses to
decide a trade is worth training more of - is simply never true again unless
every last person of that trade dies out, so in a deathless, failure-free
world a trade that got taught once, early, for two people, STAYS at two
people for the rest of the run, however many projects are starved for it.
That is not a bug this module can fix (core.py/labour.py are not this
module's to edit); it is a fact about how the given rules grow named-trade
labour, and the only lever a strategy ORDER has over it is which nodes get
to spend that frozen, tiny pool of hours, and in what sequence.

THE BINDING CONSTRAINT, MEASURED: on Rome's planned order, three nodes -
`steam_atmospheric`, `interchangeable_parts`, `spectroscope` - go active
early, need machinist/chemist/engineer hours nothing else in the run can
supply, and never finish. Fifty-six of the tree's other 168 closure nodes sit
downstream of those three and can never even start. And the planner's own
`pick_side_branches` - which ranks candidates purely by return on capital,
with no idea the tree has any scarce labour at all - hands the household
several more nodes (locomotives, TNT, dynamite, double-acting engines) that
draw on the EXACT SAME five trades, spread through the order specifically so
they compete with the spine for it throughout the run. Ranking those
candidates by how soon they can even legally start instead looks like an
obvious fix and is NOT one - tried and measured (see `pick_side_branches`'s
own docstring and PATH_SEARCH.md), it left Rome roughly unchanged and cost
Han 124 years, or cost Rome the goal entirely within 1,200 years once
reworked to stop doing that to Han. Reverted; recorded so nobody re-walks
into it.

A SECOND, LARGER CONSTRAINT, MEASURED THE SAME WAY (against the real
rome_434_goal_startable.json / rome_380_corpus_bug.json fixtures - a player
three times stronger than this order): the planned order's dice-free trial
sits at capital -4,789, zero scholars, zero artisans and 30/168 of the
closure done at year 434 AD, against the fixture's +607,402,406 / 162 / 491
/ 167/168 at the SAME calendar year - and stays that poor, essentially
unchanged, for roughly 850 MORE years (see PATH_SEARCH.md). Every one of the
eight institutions `planner.pick_staffing` already names - the same ones
that train the scholars and artisans `staff_capacity()` gates almost
everything else on - was founded by that player 322 to 800+ years before
this order manages it. `diagnose_capital_trap` reads this off a live Sim
the same way `diagnose_scarce_trades` already does; `grow_supply` (move 3
below) is what tries to do something about it.

THE SEARCH. Three moves, applied to the CPM order `planner.backward_plan`
already computes, chosen because they attack these specific, measured
constraints rather than guessing at the space of all 168! orderings:

  1. PULL every side branch that draws on a currently-scarce trade OUT of
     the interleaved order entirely, to the very end (after the spine, after
     the goal). A side branch is optional by definition - it exists only to
     fund the spine - so one that competes with the spine for the one
     resource actually blocking the spine is worse than not building it at
     all, and `refine`'s own measured finding on staffing institutions
     already established that "obviously helpful" is not the same claim as
     "measured helpful" for this exact tree.

  2. WITHIN a tied CPM slack band (nodes the graph itself cannot tell apart -
     see planner.py's own comment on why this is exactly where a seed or a
     tie-break is honest to apply), move nodes that draw on a scarce trade
     to the FRONT of the band, smallest total scarce-trade hours first. This
     is shortest-processing-time-first, the standard remedy for many jobs
     queued on one non-shareable resource: it clears the queue soonest and
     is a strict refinement of the tie-break planner.py already documents as
     legitimate, not a new principle.

  3. GROW THE SUPPLY (`grow_supply`): when a dice-free trial reads as the
     capital trap above, try founding each of `planner.pick_staffing`'s
     institutions, one at a time, and keep only the ones a fresh dice-free
     trial measures as genuinely better - not "obviously helpful", the same
     discipline as move 1. This is the one move that can ADD something to
     the order rather than only resequence what moves 1 and 2 are given;
     see PATH_SEARCH.md for what it found when actually tried against this
     tree, honestly, rather than assumed either way.

All three moves are computed FROM a diagnostic run of the real Sim, not from
a second model of the tree - `diagnose_scarce_trades` and
`diagnose_capital_trap` read `s.active`, `s.employees`, `s.capital`,
`s.scholars`/`s.artisans` and `s.hours_you_can_call_on` off an actual
simulated household, the same object `run` would build. Each round
re-diagnoses from the current order's own simulated state, so a trade that
stops being scarce (finished, unblocked) stops being treated as one, and a
round - or a candidate institution - that does not improve on the previous
best is simply not kept - see `search()`. This is "repeatedly relaxing
whatever the binding constraint turns out to be", one of the two methods the
brief itself names, extended from "resequence what is named" (moves 1-2) to
"try adding what is missing" (move 3) once resequencing alone was measured,
across a wide range of side-branch counts and placements, not to touch this
particular constraint at all (PATH_SEARCH.md). Still chosen over a
from-scratch metaheuristic (random-restart hill-climbing over raw orderings,
simulated annealing, ...) because the constraints here are not diffuse -
they are five named trades and eight named institutions, provably - and
searching blindly over 168! orderings to rediscover a fact already visible
in `s.active`/`s.capital` would be slower and no more honest than reading it
off the Sim directly.
