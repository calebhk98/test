"""Prove an optimisation changed nothing.

An optimisation is only worth having if the game it speeds up is the same
game. This records a hash of the ENTIRE simulation state after every single
year of a set of reference runs - several civilisations, several seeds, fog
on and off, optimiser and manual - and writes them to a JSON file.

    python3 rome/sim/perf_fingerprint.py record baseline.json
    ...make a change...
    python3 rome/sim/perf_fingerprint.py check baseline.json

`check` re-runs the same scenarios and reports the FIRST year at which any
run diverges, and which fields differ. A year-by-year hash rather than a
final-state hash on purpose: a final-state comparison tells you that
something broke, and a per-year one tells you when, which is most of the way
to telling you why.

Timing comes free with it: `record` and `check` both print the CPU time each
scenario took, so the same command that proves you broke nothing also tells
you how much faster it got.
