ROME 100 AD -> TRANSISTOR : tech-tree simulator, planner and game.

  a RECORD : validate, costs, path   dump the tree and its economics
  a TOOL   : run, compare, sweep     Monte-Carlo a strategy, find where it breaks
  a GAME   : play, agent             step through it yourself, or let a script play

    python3 rome/sim/simulator.py validate
    python3 rome/sim/simulator.py civs                       who you can play
    python3 rome/sim/simulator.py play --manual               free choice, no autopilot
    python3 rome/sim/simulator.py agent --civ rome_100ad --fog

`agent` speaks one JSON object per line in and one per line out. It explains
itself: it prints a welcome on first run and answers {"cmd":"help"}. There is
no protocol document to read, on purpose.

No third-party dependencies. Python 3.8+.
Design notes and the full protocol: rome/sim/PROTOCOL.md

THIS FILE IS THE FRONT DOOR, not the engine. The engine was one 5,600-line
module; it is now rome/sim/engine/, split by subject. Everything that was
importable from `simulator` still is, because every playtest note, every test
and every instruction anyone has ever been given says `rome/sim/simulator.py`,
and that must not stop being true because the inside was tidied.
