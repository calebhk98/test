"""Check that quotations in the character sheets actually appear in the manuscript.

A sheet writer working from memory can produce a quotation that reads exactly like
the book, attach a real file and line number to it, and mark it [text]. That is worse
than an honest gap: the author revises toward a line that was never written.

This finds them. For every quoted string in characters/*.md that is long enough to be
a real citation, it searches the manuscript for the text. Anything not found is
reported with the sheet and line it came from.

    python3 verify_citations.py
    python3 verify_citations.py --min-words 4
    python3 verify_citations.py characters/RUTH.md

Matching is deliberately loose - case, curly quotes, and internal whitespace are
normalised - so a hit means the words really are in the book and a miss is worth
looking at by hand. Ellipses inside a quotation split it into fragments, each checked
separately.
