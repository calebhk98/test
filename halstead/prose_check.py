"""Flag banned constructions, negative framing, and book references in the sheets.

PROSE_RULES.md rules 1 and 2 ban two families of construction. Rule 1 covers
sentences whose work is a verdict on correctness or ranking. Rule 2 covers
sentences that define a thing by what it is not, or undercut a claim in the
breath that makes it.

    python3 prose_check.py
    python3 prose_check.py characters/RUTH.md --show
    python3 prose_check.py --rule 2

A first version of this check used loose patterns and reported "the sentence
that is correcting them" as a verdict phrase and "narrow rather than broad" as
negation. Both patterns below are written to avoid that: the verdict list
requires a word boundary after the adjective, and the negation list looks for
a denial of an interpretation rather than any ordinary contrast.
