"""One command for the whole picture: readability, style, numbers, voice, integrity.

The measurements live in five scripts that grew separately and each answer one
question. This runs all of them, in a fixed order, with the arguments that make
them comparable, so there is one thing to run and one report to read.

    python3 grade.py                 the whole report
    python3 grade.py --table         just the per-chapter table
    python3 grade.py --targets       just the table plus the distance to target
    python3 grade.py --brief         drop the slow sections (voice, citations)

What comes from where:

  prose_grade.py       sixteen measures graded as percentiles against 23 real
                       books, plus Flesch-Kincaid, ARI and an approximate
                       Lexile. This is the spine of the report.
  style_report.py      the two things prose_grade does not measure: how much of
                       a chapter is dialogue, and how far spoken and narrated
                       sentence lengths sit apart. Its PASS/FAIL thresholds are
                       invented and are deliberately not reproduced here.
  number_report.py     whether the same handful of numbers keeps recurring.
  voice_separation.py  whether each character's dialogue is distinguishable
                       from everyone else's.
  verify_citations.py  quotations in the character sheets that are not in the
                       manuscript.
  prose_check.py       PROSE_RULES violations in the character sheets.
  quote_length.py      sentences per quotation, against the corpus.
  banned_phrases.py    phrases the author has ruled out by name.
  style_report.py      conjunction rates and the narrator tic scan.
  check_edits.py       em dashes and the hard-line-break convention.

Targets are the author's: Flesch-Kincaid about 7, Lexile about 1000. The
corpus median is shown beside them because a target with nothing to compare it
against is a number somebody made up.
