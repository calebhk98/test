"""Phrases the author has ruled out, checked against the chapters.

This file exists because of a failure, and the failure is worth stating. The
author flagged *"and I want to be clear about that before anything else"* every
single time he came across it, was told a check had been added, and found it
still in chapter 1 several passes later. No check had been added. `prose_check.py`
scans the character sheets and has never looked at a chapter.

A ruling that lives only in a conversation gets lost. A ruling with a row in a
script does not. Anything the author rules out by name goes in here, with the
reason, and `grade.py` runs it.
