"""Chapters that have drifted more formal than the rest of the book.

Readers found this before any script did. Two of them read chapters 25 and 26
and said the prose had gone formal in a way the first twenty-four had not:
"possesses a voice built for open ground", "in the manner of somebody settling
in", "the particular variety of cold that reaches the fingers a considerable
time before it reaches anything else". They were right, and the thing they were
hearing turned out to be countable.

The count is words of nine letters or more as a share of all words. It is crude
and it works, because the formality in this book arrives as vocabulary rather
than as syntax: a plain observation puts on a long coat. Chapter 25 came in at
5.55% against a book median of 2.54%, the highest of all thirty-six chapters
and more than double the middle of the book.

The judgement is against the book's own median rather than against the corpus,
which is the point. The question is not whether the prose is ornate for a
novel, it is whether a chapter reads as though a different person wrote it. A
chapter is flagged at more than 1.6 times the median, which lets the later
chapters sit where they already sit, since the book does get denser as Chloe
gets older and that rise is wanted.
