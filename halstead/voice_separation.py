"""Measure how distinguishable each character's dialogue is from the others'.

The swap test - would anyone notice if this line moved to another character? -
is a judgement call. This is the measurable version: extract each character's
lines, compute the same statistics for each speaker, and show how far apart
they sit. Characters whose numbers coincide have no voice yet.

    python3 voice_separation.py            # both channels
    python3 voice_separation.py --chat     # group chat only
    python3 voice_separation.py --prose    # tagged prose dialogue only

Two channels, measured separately because they are attributable with very
different confidence.

CHAT is exact. Messages are "name: text", so every line has a known speaker
and none are missed.

PROSE IS A BIASED SAMPLE and its numbers must be read with that in mind. Only
lines carrying an explicit "<name> says" tag can be attributed, and the book
drops the tag once a two-hander is established, which is the style guide's own
advice. Tagged lines therefore skew towards the openings of exchanges, which
run short. Treat the prose figures as comparable BETWEEN characters, since the
bias hits every character alike, and not as an estimate of that character's
true average line length.

# the wrong end of it. In a two-hander the tag usually rides on the ANSWER, so
# the question is the turn most likely to go untagged. Counting questions off
# tagged lines therefore undercounts them systematically. RUTH.md carried
# "0% questions, never a question mark" as a law of the character on that
# basis; reading her turns by hand gives 41 questions in 191 turns, about 21%,
# with 16 spoken turns ending in a question mark. Never take a zero from this
# script as a fact about a person. Compare speakers with each other, and read
# the scenes before writing any rule into a sheet.
