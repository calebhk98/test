"""Prose statistics and tic scan for a Halstead chapter.

This is the script embedded at the end of STYLE_GUIDES.md, reconstructed into a
runnable file. That copy was pasted through a markdown escaper, which put
backslashes in front of most operators ("t \\= load(path)") and mangled the
regex character classes, so it could not run as printed. Thresholds, output
format and metric definitions are unchanged from it.

Only deliberate change: numpy is replaced with the standard library. np.median,
np.mean and np.std(ddof=1) are statistics.median, fmean and stdev exactly, so
the numbers are identical and the script has no dependencies.
