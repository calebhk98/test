"""Grade prose maturity against a reference corpus, not against invented targets.

style_report.py checks a chapter against the numbers written into
STYLE_GUIDES.md. Several of those have no source behind them, and some have
floors that reward choppier writing: chapter 8, the most grown-up chapter in
the book, fails there partly for not having ENOUGH short sentences.

This grades differently. Every measure is compared against 23 real books, and
reported as a percentile in that field plus a straight win/loss against one
named book. The default benchmark is Peter Pan, which is below the target
audience, so losing to it on a measure is a clear signal rather than a
judgement call.

    python3 prose_grade.py --build-reference DIR1 DIR2   # regenerate the corpus file

Sixteen measures are graded. Twelve cover the sentence and the word: length,
subordination, relative clauses, clause-free sentences, short runs, commas,
reading grade, lexical diversity, long words, common words, and the two bands
at either end. Four more were added later to cover what those twelve miss and
what a reader actually notices: sentence-length variation, words per paragraph,
sentences per paragraph, and mean word length.

A further group is measured but not graded, in MONITOR. These are patterns
with no maturity direction, or ones under a house ban, where the useful output
is the corpus range rather than a percentile: how often a sentence opens on a
subordinate clause, how often it carries two "and"s, and the plain "and" rate.
Grading them would reward moving a number that is not a maturity signal.

Reference data lives in prose_reference.json next to this script. The corpus
texts themselves are not in the repository; the JSON is the durable artifact,
and rebuilding it needs the book files again.
