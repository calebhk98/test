"""How many sentences a character gets to say before the quotation marks close.

The book was written with a strong one-line-per-turn habit, and the habit is
measurable: 82% of its quotations were a single sentence against a corpus
median of 76%, and only 6% ran to three or more against a median of 12%. That
puts it at the clipped end of the corpus, beside Peter Pan and Alice, when the
prose everywhere else is at the other end. Characters should be able to say
"What? No. We can't do that, it hurts us. We should do X instead." in one
breath, and mostly they cannot.

Chat transcripts are excluded: they are lowercase, unpunctuated and follow
their own convention, so counting sentences in them is meaningless.

# TARGETS. Read this before changing any number below.
#
# These bands come from FOUR NAMED BOOKS, not from percentiles, and that is
# deliberate. A reviewer caught the repository building an impossible target
# out of column-wise percentiles, twice:
#
#   "You cannot combine the 75th percentile of mean (20.4), the 75th percentile
#    of <=4w (35.9%), the 75th percentile of 5-29w (60.7%) and the 75th
#    percentile of >=30w (18.8%). If you sum those bucket percentages you get
#    115.4%. It creates a statistically impossible book, because the columns
#    are coupled: every turn falls in exactly one bin and they sum to 100."
#
# Worse, the coupling runs the OPPOSITE way from what mixing the columns
# assumes. Across the corpus, a longer mean goes with FEWER short lines, not
# more: Black Beauty has the longest mean at 37.3 and one of the lowest short
# shares at 14.5%, while Men Without Women has the shortest mean at 6.5 and the
# highest short share at 43.7%. Aiming at p75 of the mean AND p75 of the short
# share aims at two different books at once.
#
# **The rule for anyone editing this file: pick real books whose profile you
# want and use their whole rows. Never mix percentiles across these columns.**
#
# The author's chosen references, and their actual measured rows:
#
#   book                mean   CV%   <=4w   5-29w   >=30w    sum
#   tom_sawyer          17.0   148   26.2    58.4    15.4   100.0
#   treasure_island     22.2   148   25.6    52.1    22.3   100.0
#   little_women        23.4   113   13.4    61.1    25.5   100.0
#   wind_in_willows     27.8   152   20.4    50.8    28.8   100.0
#
# and his stated aims within that group: a mean "of like 20ish, plus or minus a
# bit", a CV "of like 125, or like 115-135", and short replies at "a max of
# ~30, goal closer to 20-25". The bands below are those, widened only to the

    A regex over straight quotes cannot tell a closing mark from an apostrophe

    of narration between two stray marks. Hemingway produced a 2,993-word
    "quotation" that way and This Side of Paradise a 1,899-word one, and those
    wrecked the standard deviation the corpus targets were built on. A real
    spoken turn does not cross a paragraph break: a genuine multi-paragraph
    speech reopens the quotation mark on each paragraph. So spans containing a
    blank line are dropped, on both sides of the comparison.
